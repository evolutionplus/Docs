# 1. INTRODUCTION 

The number of gamers in the world exceeds 2 400 000 000 people to date. It is more than 30% of humanity. Video Game Industry have a significant impact on the mentality and culture of many countries. The world of ESports is growing rapidly. Blockbusters based on different  video  games  are  filmed.  Video  games  are  used  in  education,  military,  the development of Artificial Intelligence etc.

Gamer generation, on average, spends more than 10 000 hours in video games to the start of their professional activity. During playtime, they acquire many useful skills and abilities: multitasking,  concentration,  fast  reaction  time,  diligence,  systems  thinking,  increased neuroplasticity, the ability to cooperation in online communities.

In addition, gamers easily learn the latest technologies. However, they ignore intrusive and uninteresting information. To date, the vast majority of people do not have the necessary degree  of  involvement  in  real  activity.  To  realize  their  potential  new  techniques  of motivation are required.

Evolution+  Team  has  been  developing  the  Platform  to  stimulate  activity  by  game mechanics. The Platform is integrated with Ethereum blockchain, which allows the use of cryptotokens  (ERC-20)  and  decentralized  virtual  property  (ERC-721).  Using  the  neural network allows to predict the behavior of participants based on the activity history.

In 2018 we plan to build the Ecosystem of the Platform, and to begin expansion into global markets. In 2019 Evolution+ is going to become a complete and recognizable solution for gamification in business, education and social management. In the future we will continue researching the field of algorithms for behavior management and Artificial Intelligence.

We believe that in the next 5-8 years game mechanics will become a mandatory attribute of most human activities.


# 2. ABOUT THE PROJECT

Evolution+ is a Gamification Platform integrated with Blockchain Technology and Neural Network. The Platform allows anyone to easily implement game mechanics in any website or web service to improved user engagement and business process efficiency.

The Platform is a tool for organizations aimed at positive interaction with the modern generation of gamers, and gaining a competitive advantage from practical use of Artificial Intelligence and Cryptoeconomics.

With the help of the blockchain participants are guaranteed the right of ownership of the awards. Integration with the Ethereum blockchain allows to increase user activity with cryptotokens and decentralized virtual property.

A  set  of  tools  for  developers  allow  anyone  to  integrate  Evolution+  in  various IT-environments. 


## 2.1. GAME MECHANICS

Evolution+  has  a  set  of  mechanics  distinctive  for  computer  games.  The  participants 
involved in the process get social status, rating points, token rewards and currency, based 
on their real activity.

The Platform control functions allow to adjust rules based on which participants will be 
awarded. This allows to implement game mechanics into various activities.

The mechanics of the Evolution+ Platform:

### VIRTUAL ECONOMY

*	**In-Game Currency.** Virtual money on which the game economy is based. Smart-contracts ERC-20 
are supported. 
*	**Virtual Property.** In-game items. Smart-contracts ERC-721 are supported.
*	**Marketplace.** Online store of virtual property.

### GAME SCENARIOS

*	**Missions.** Tasks that a participant may complete in order to gain a reward.
*	**Mini Games.** Simple online-game modules.
*	**Rules.** A system of parameters by which participants are encouraged or punished.

### SYMBOLIC AWARDS

*	**XP + Levels.** Game status of the participant and basic quantitative assessment of progress.
*	**Characteristics.** Quantitative assessment of progress on various personal indicators.
*	**Achievements.** Collections of locked rewards that the player unlocks during activity.
*	**Badges.** Symbolic awards and penalty.

### SOCIAL INTERACTION

*	**Ratings.** Comparison of results of participants on various indicators and awarding of leaders.
*	**Contests.** Functionality for online voting using game mechanics.
*	**Competitions.** Struggle for leadership between individual participants.
*	**Teams.** Competing communities of participants.
*	**Raids.** Temporary groups aimed at the rapid achievement of target goal.

The game mechanics of Evolution+ allow to take into account the interests of all of the personality types according to the Bartle Test.

| Explorer    |	Learning and manipulation |	Game scenarios, game balance, hidden content. |
| Socializer | Communication and Positive |	Social interaction, social rewards. |
| Achiever   | Possession and accumulation	| Virtual economy, collecting. |

## 2.2. BLOCKCHAIN

The use of blockchain technology in gamification guarantees ownership of awards and virtual property, and allows to include elements of cryptoeconomy to in-game mechanics.

**Using the blockchain achieves the following objectives:**

* Decentralized storage of awards
* Awarding with cryptotokens
* Decentralization of virtual property
* Implementation of game mechanics based on smart-contracts

Evolution+  Platform  is  integrated  with  Ethereum  blockchain  and  includes  established functions for automatic awarding users with cryptotokens for useful activities, such as: attracting new members, acquiring certain goods or services, performing tasks etc.

The Platform supports smart-contracts of ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards. The functionality of game balance adjustment allows taking into account the economic interests of all parties.

## 2.3. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Platform's  Artificial  Intelligence  is  based  on  the  principle  of  stereotyped  patterns  of behaviour.    Neural  network  detects  patterns  of  behaviour  and  characteristics  of participants using different trigger actions and history of participant's activity. Artificial intelligence calculates the likelihood of participants making certain actions in the future, and automatically highlights the target groups.

**With the help of Artificial Intelligence, the following tasks are achieved:**

* Prediction of behavior.
* Highlighting target groups for campaigns
* Formation of a psychological portrait of individual participants and the audience in 
general
