# 1. INTRODUCTION 

To date, the number of gamers in the world exceeds 1 800 000 000 people. It is more than 25% of humanity. Computer games have a significant impact on the mentality and culture of many countries. ESports is growing rapidly. Blockbusters based on different video games are filmed. Experiments are conducted in the field of gamification. Video games are used in education, military, the development of artificial intelligence etc.
Gamer generation, on average, spends more than 10 000 hours in video games to the start of their professional activity. During playtime, they acquire many useful skills: multitasking, keen attention, good reaction time, diligence, systems thinking, increased neuroplasticity, the ability to communicate effectively in online communities.
In addition, gamers easily learn the latest technologies, however, they ignore Intrusive and uninteresting information. To date, the vast majority of people do not have the necessary degree of involvement in real activity. To open and to direct their potential new tools of motivation are required.
Evolution+ Team has been developing the platform to stimulate activity by using game mechanics and cryptotokens and to predict the behaviour using artificial intelligence.
In 2018 we plan to build the ecosystem of the platform and to begin expansion into global markets. In 2019 Evolution+ is going to become a full and recognized solution for gamification in business, education and social management. In the future we will continue researching the field of management algorithms for a behavior, developing the platform functionality and artificial intelligence.
We believe that in the next 5-8 years game mechanics will become a mandatory attribute of most human activities.

# 2. ABOUT THE PROJECT

Evolution+ is a platform for gamification integrated with blockchain and neural network. The platform can be implemented in different scenarios of game mechanic to control the behavior.
The platform is a tool for control, commercial and educational structures aimed at positive interaction with the modern generation of gamers and gain a competitive advantage from the practical application of artificial intelligence and cryptoeconomics.
With the help of the blockchain guaranteed possession of rating points and virtual property is ensured to participants. Integration with the blockchain-platform Ethereum allows you to stimulate activity ofan audience with cryptotokens.
Artificial intelligence platform analyzes activity history of the audience. On the basis of accumulated information AI predicts behaviour and automatically selects target groups of participants.
API and system of widgets allow you to integrate Evolution+ in various IT-infrastructures. With the development of the project, integration with major services is going to be included.

## 2.1. GAME MECHANICS

Evolution+ has a set of mechanics distinctive for computer games.
The participants involved in the process get social status, rating points, token rewards and currency, based on their real activity.
Control functions of the platform allow to adjust rules based on which participants will be awarded. This allows to implement game mechanics into various activities.

| Killer    	| Dominance and competition |	Status, leadership, competition. |
| Explorer    |	Learning and manipulation |	Game scenarios, game balance, hidden content. |
| Socializer | Communication and Positive |	Social interaction, social rewards. |
| Achiever   | Possession and accumulation	| Virtual property, collecting. |

## 2.2. BLOCKCHAIN
The use of blockchain technology in gamification ensures guaranteed possession of virtual property, and allows to include elements of cryptoeconomy to in-game mechanics.

Using the blockchain achieves the following objectives:

-	Decentralized storage of rating points
-	Awarding with cryptotokens
-	Tokenization of virtual property
-	Implementation of game mechanics based on smart-contracts

Evolution+ Platform is integrated with Ethereum blockchain and includes established functions for automatic awarding users with cryptotokens for useful activities, such as: attracting new members, accuiring certain goods or services, performing tasks, etc. The platform supports any of ERC20 tokens. Game balance can be adjusted so that cost of transactions when awarding will not exceed a predetermined percentage of profits brought by the activity of the participant.

## 2.3. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Platform's artificial intelligence is based on the principle of stereotyped patterns of behaviour.
Neural network detects patterns of behaviour and characteristics of participants using different trigger actions and history of participant's activity.
Artificial intelligence calculates the likelihood of participants making certain actions in the future and automatically highlights the target groups.

With the help of artificial intelligence the following tasks are achieved:
- Prediction of behavior.
- Selection of target groups for targeted campaigns
- Formation of a psychological portrait of individual participants and the audience in general

# 3. EVP TOKENS

EVP Token is a utilitarian digital asset of Evolution+, which you can use to acquire license of the platform and services of company.
EVP tokens are issued with limited emission. Maximum number: 22 000 000 tokens.
The token rate for the period of the ICO: 1 EVP = 1 USD. After the ICO the rate will be determined by bidding on the exchange.
The number of the token determines the weight of holder's voice during public voting for changes to the platform.
The token is not a share and does not give any rights to control the company Evolution+.

## 3.1. TOKEN DISTRIBUTION

60% - 13 200 000 of tokens are distributed in the ICO process.
20% - 4 400 000 of tokens are reserved for members of the ecosystem Evolution+ and distributed according to the gaming mechanics during and after the ICO.
20% - 4 400 000 of tokens remain to the team Evolution+.
Retained in the process of ICO tokens and tokens received for license on the platform can be imitated later or distributed between members of the ecosystem Evolution+ according to the game mechanics.
