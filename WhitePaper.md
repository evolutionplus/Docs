# 1. INTRODUCTION 

The number of gamers in the world exceeds 2 400 000 000 people to date. It is more than 
30% of humanity. Video Game Industry have a significant impact on the mentality and 
culture of many countries. ESports is growing rapidly. Blockbusters based on different 
video games are filmed. Video games are used in education, military, the development of 
Artificial Intelligence etc.

Gamer generation, on average, spends more than 10 000 hours in video games to the start 
of their professional activity. During playtime, they acquire many useful skills and abilities: 
multitasking, keen attention, fast reaction time, diligence, systems thinking, increased neuroplasticity, the ability to cooperation in online communities.

In addition, gamers easily learn the latest technologies, however, they ignore intrusive and 
uninteresting information. To date, the vast majority of people do not have the necessary 
degree of involvement in real activity. To realize their potential new techniques of motivation are required.

Evolution+ Team has been developing the Platform to stimulate activity by game and social mechanic. The Platform is integrated with Ethereum blockchain, which allows the use of cryptotokens (ERC-20) and decentralized virtual property (ERC-721). Using the neural network allows to predict the behavior of participants based on the activity history.

In 2018 we plan to build the Ecosystem of the Platform, and to begin expansion into global 
markets. In 2019 Evolution+ is going to become a complete and recognizable solution for 
gamification in business, education and social management. In the future we will continue 
researching the field of algorithms for behavior management and Artificial Intelligence.

We believe that in the next 5-8 years game mechanics will become a mandatory attribute 
of most human activities.


# 2. ABOUT THE PROJECT

Evolution+ is a platform for gamification integrated with blockchain and neural network. 
The Platform can be implemented in different scenarios of gaming mechanics to manage 
the behaviour.

The Platform is a tool for management, commercial, and educational structures aimed at 
positive interaction with the modern generation of gamers, and gaining a competitive 
advantage from the practical use of Artificial Intelligence and cryptoeconomics. 

With the help of blockchain participants are guaranteed the right of ownership of the 
awards. Integration with the blockchain-platform Ethereum allows to stimulate activity of an 
audience with cryptotokens and decentralized virtual property.

Artificial Intelligence analyzes activity history of the audience. On the basis of accumulated 
information AI predicts behaviour and automatically selects target groups of participants.

A set of tools for developers allow anyone to integrate Evolution+ in various IT-environments. 


## 2.1. GAME MECHANICS

Evolution+  has  a  set  of  mechanics  distinctive  for  computer  games.  The  participants 
involved in the process get social status, rating points, token rewards and currency, based 
on their real activity.

The platform control functions allow to adjust rules based on which participants will be 
awarded. This allows to implement game mechanics into various activities.

The mechanics of the Evolution+ platform 

*	Levels
*	Features
*	Ratings
*	Game balance
*	Game scenarios
*	Symbolic awards
*	Social rewards
*	Virtual economy
*	Competition
*	Contests
*	Team
*	Referral system

Game mechanics of Evolution+ allow us to account interests of all of the personality types according to the Bartle Test System.

| Personality type	| Key interests	| Control algorithms |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------------- |
| Killer    	| Dominance and rivalry |	Status, leadership, competition. |
| Explorer    |	Learning and manipulation |	Game scenarios, game balance, hidden content. |
| Socializer | Communication and Positive |	Social interaction, social rewards. |
| Achiever   | Possession and accumulation	| Virtual property, collecting. |

## 2.2. BLOCKCHAIN
The use of blockchain technology in gamification provides guaranteed ownership of virtual 
property, and allows to include elements of cryptoeconomy to in-game mechanics.

Using the blockchain achieves the following objectives:

* Decentralized storage of rating points
* Awarding with cryptotokens
* Tokenization of virtual property
* Implementation of game mechanics based on smart-contracts

Evolution+ Platform is integrated with Ethereum blockchain and includes established functions for automatic awarding users with cryptotokens for useful activities, such as: attracting new members, acquiring certain goods or services, performing tasks, etc.

The Platform supports smart-contracts of ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards. The functionality 
of game balance adjustment allows taking into account the economic interests of all participants.

## 2.3. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Platform's Artificial Intelligence is based on the principle of stereotyped patterns of behaviour. Neural network detects patterns of behaviour and characteristics of participants using different trigger actions and history of participant's activity. Artificial intelligence calculates the likelihood of participants making certain actions in the future, and automatically highlights the target groups.

With the help of Artificial Intelligence, the following tasks are achieved:
* Prediction of behavior.
* Selection of target groups for targeted campaigns
* Formation of a psychological portrait of individual participants and the audience in general


## 2.4. INTEGRATIONS

To automatically log actions, and interact with participants, the Platform integrates with various IT environments. 


# 3. USE-CASES
